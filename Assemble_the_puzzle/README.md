# Puzzle game
## Description
This project is an interactive Puzzle game in which the player is asked to assemble an image,
broken into pieces, into its original form. Using web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,
the original 450x300 pixel image is split into 50x50 pixel tiles. 
The player is given a field of 9x6 tiles, shuffled randomly. The goal of the game is to move tiles around the field to restore the image to its original form.
